# Simple-Email-Validator
No API's, no limits. This Python script checks the validity of email addresses in a CSV file. The validation process includes syntax checking, domain validation, SMTP validation, SMTP server status checking, and catch-all checking.   The results, including a score and confidence level for each email address, are written to a new CSV file.
